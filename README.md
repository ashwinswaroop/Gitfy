Gitfy is a serverless GitHub repository tracker with push notifications for iOS. It is designed to help repository owners and administrators track and be notified of important events which occur on those repositories.

You can use Gitfy to keep track of your team's daily code commits or simply just to find out whenever someone has forked your repository. Gitfy will currently notify the user of the following events:

* Commit
* Issue
* Push
* Pull Request
* Fork
* Star
* Release

Gitfy is a serverless application which creates repository webhooks and uses Firebase Cloud Functions to route webhook triggers back to the end user. The absence of a server allows the application to react quickly and efficiently to GitHub events and notify the user immediately.

Gitfy is an open source application. All issues and questions can be raised on it's GitHub [page](github.com/ashwinswaroop/Gitfy)
You can also use this page to track any upcoming changes and features to the application.
